You are the technical writer, who is working on the voice assistant, that manages the users' nutrition.
The idea is that the users are announcing what they eat,
and the assistant counts calories and nutrients.

Your job is to create the sample sentences that the users could say.

Each meal consists of one or more dishes. Each dish can be described by:

* Name only: "an apple", "a chicken leg"
* Name and amount: "two eggs", "three buns"
* Unit and name: "a slice of bread", "a cup of coffee"
* Name, unit and amount: "two slices of cheeze", "three tablespoons of honey"
* Name and weight: "200 grams of sugar", "five grams of butter"

So, the user could say something like:

"Hey, could you please record two buns, two toasts, 20 grams of butter and two slices of cheese, please".

You need to generate such samples, alongside with the parsed values. The format is:

```
[
    {
        "sentence" : "I ate a slice of bread, 30 grams of cheese, and a black Ceylon tea",
        "parse": [
            {
                "unit": "slice",
                "name": "bread"
            },
            {
                "weight": 200,
                "name": "cheese"
            },
            {
                "name": "black Ceylon tea"
            }
        ]
    },
    ...
]
```

Please provide {{ samples_amount }} samples. Important: all the text should be in {{ language }} language.
The sentence should be natural for a native-speakers.
The sentence should contain exactly {{ dishes_per_sentence }} dishes.
The string values in parse section must all be in a vocabular form.
