You are a data generator for a voice assistant project. Your task is to produce 30 unique examples of user utterances that request setting a timer. Output exactly one JSON object per line (JSONL). Each object must have keys: `"USER"` (string), `"HOURS"` (int), `"MINUTES"` (int), `"SECONDS"` (int). After the 100th JSON line, stop. Do not add any commentary.

Constraints:

- "HOURS" in [1, 99] (or words: "one" to "ninety-nine"), "MINUTES" in [1, 99] (or words: "one" to "ninety-nine"), "SECONDS" in [1, 99] (or words: "one" to "ninety-nine"). Zero value is also allowed, but then it should not be written in the USER.
    
- Generate examples of time durations expressed in natural, spoken-like ways.
	
- Utterances must clearly request setting a timer, not just state a duration.

- Variation rule: Vary the phrasing of user requests so that they don’t all start with the same pattern. Ensure the dataset contains diverse wording and does not repeat the same style too often.
    
- You may use direct numerals (like "5 minutes" or "2 hours") most of the time, and occasionally include fractional but exact expressions (e.g., half an hour, a quarter of an hour). Avoid vague or approximate phrases like a couple of minutes or several seconds.
    
- You may generate examples with hours only, minutes only, seconds only, or any combination.
    
- Use either words or digits for numerals in each utterance, but make sure your dataset contains both types across examples. Do not mix words and digits in the same USER string.
    
- Minutes and seconds exceeding 59 are allowed and should not be automatically converted (e.g., `"MINUTES":75` is acceptable).
    
- "USER" must sound natural for voice commands, as if it came from a spoken user request via TTS/STT. Avoid shorthand abbreviations (_"h"_, _"min"_, _"sec"_).
    
- Include a variety of tones: casual, polite, commanding, exclamatory.
    
- In your examples, sometimes use typical durations (e.g., 5 minutes, half an hour, 2 hours) and sometimes unusual but natural durations (e.g., 38 minutes, 17 hours, 73 seconds). Make sure your dataset includes both types in roughly balanced proportions. For unusual durations, use a wide range of numbers for hours, minutes, and seconds, ensuring that each unit appears with small, medium, and large values across the dataset. Include diverse non-zero combinations of time units, and avoid always following the “hours → minutes → seconds” order by varying unit combinations and permutations.
    
- Do not add extra fields.
    

Format examples:

```json
{"USER":"please start a five minute timer for me","HOURS":0,"MINUTES":5,"SECONDS":0}
{"USER":"Can you put on a 45 second timer","HOURS":0,"MINUTES":0,"SECONDS":45}
{"USER":"set a timer for twenty minutes","HOURS":0,"MINUTES":20,"SECONDS":0}
{"USER":"Oh put on a 73 second timer quickly","HOURS":0,"MINUTES":0,"SECONDS":73}
{"USER":"let’s have a half hour timer","HOURS":0,"MINUTES":30,"SECONDS":0}
{"USER":"start a one hour and fifteen second timer","HOURS":1,"MINUTES":0,"SECONDS":15}
{"USER":"Give me a 2 hour and 47 second timer","HOURS":2,"MINUTES":0,"SECONDS":47}
{"USER":"can you set a twelve hour thirty four minute and fifty six second timer","HOURS":12,"MINUTES":34,"SECONDS":56}
{"USER":"Could you please set a fifteen minute timer","HOURS":0,"MINUTES":15,"SECONDS":0}
{"USER":"start a 30 second timer","HOURS":0,"MINUTES":0,"SECONDS":30}
```
