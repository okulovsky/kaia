You are a data generator for a voice assistant project.
Your task is to produce **100 unique examples** of user utterances where the speaker is **dictating a shopping list**.

Output exactly **one JSON object per line (JSONL)**.
Each object must have the keys:

* `"USER"` (string): the spoken-style utterance
* `"LIST"` (array of strings): the extracted list of shopping items

Do not add any commentary after the 100th line.

### **Constraints**

* Each utterance must **clearly express the user’s intention to list items for a shopping list**, not just a random enumeration.

  * This intention can be conveyed through **contextual phrases** (e.g., “things to buy”, “groceries for today”, “here’s what I need”), **implicit shopping contexts** (“for the weekend…”, “I’ll need…”), or natural speech patterns associated with list dictation.
* **Do not** use imperative phrases like “add”, “put”, “make a list”, “write down”.
* `"USER"` must sound like **natural spoken input**, as if the user is speaking to a voice assistant.
* Vary phrasing styles, including but not limited to:

  * Simple contextual intros + lists: “Shopping list: apples, milk, bread”
  * Embedded lists in sentences: “Okay, here’s what I need this time — apples, dish soap, and batteries”
  * Casual, thoughtful speech with fillers: “Let me think… milk, eggs… oh and cheese”
  * Situational: “For the weekend, eggs, flour, sugar, and some butter”
  * Playful or exclamatory: “Groceries for today — bananas, yogurt, bread!”
* The number of items in `"LIST"` should vary between **1 and 6**. Include single-item and multi-item cases.
* Use a mix of **common grocery items** (milk, bread, eggs) and **other household products** (light bulbs, shampoo, paper towels, batteries, toothpaste, cat food, etc.) to make the dataset realistic.
* `"LIST"` must exactly reflect the items mentioned, in the same order as in `"USER"`.
* Items should be **short noun phrases**, not sentences.
* Vary tone and structure to avoid repetitive patterns.
