You are a data generator for a voice assistant project. Your task is to produce 50 unique examples of user utterances that request setting a timer. Output exactly one JSON object per line (JSONL). Each object must have keys: `"USER"` (string), `"HOURS"` (int), `"MINUTES"` (int), `"SECONDS"` (int), `"NAME"` (string). After the 30th JSON line, stop. Do not add any commentary.

Constraints:

* "HOURS" in [1, 99] (or words: "one" to "ninety-nine"), "MINUTES" in [1, 99] (or words: "one" to "ninety-nine"), "SECONDS" in [1, 99] (or words: "one" to "ninety-nine"). Zero value is allowed, but then it should not be written in the USER.
* `"NAME"` is sometimes `_` (None), and sometimes a meaningful label inferred from the USER utterance. Ensure **roughly half of the examples have a meaningful NAME**, and half are `_`.
* **Variety in mentioning timer names:** Do not always use "for X". Use phrases like: `"on the X"`, `"to cook X"`, `"for my X"`, `"as X"`, `"to remind me about X"`, `"set X"`, `"timer X"`, `"in X"`, etc. The dataset should reflect natural speech patterns, not repetitive phrasing.
* Generate examples of time durations expressed in natural, spoken-like ways.
* Utterances must clearly request setting a timer, not just state a duration.
* Vary the phrasing of user requests so they don’t all start with the same pattern. Ensure the dataset contains diverse wording and does not repeat the same style too often.
* Use either words or digits for numerals, but do not mix them in the same USER string.
* Include both typical durations (e.g., 5 minutes, half an hour, 2 hours) and unusual but natural durations (e.g., 38 minutes, 17 hours, 73 seconds).
* Include diverse non-zero combinations of time units, and do not always follow the “hours → minutes → seconds” order.
* "USER" must sound natural for voice commands via TTS/STT. Avoid shorthand abbreviations (*"h"*, *"min"*, *"sec"*).

Format examples (now with **variety in how NAME is referenced**):

```json
{"USER":"please start a five minute timer","HOURS":0,"MINUTES":5,"SECONDS":0,"NAME":"_"}
{"USER":"Can you put on a 45 second timer","HOURS":0,"MINUTES":0,"SECONDS":45,"NAME":"_"}

{"USER":"start a 10 minute timer on chicken","HOURS":0,"MINUTES":10,"SECONDS":0,"NAME":"chicken"}
{"USER":"set a half hour timer to cook the oven","HOURS":0,"MINUTES":30,"SECONDS":0,"NAME":"oven"}
{"USER":"put a 2 hour timer as laundry","HOURS":2,"MINUTES":0,"SECONDS":0,"NAME":"laundry"}
{"USER":"start a 12 minute timer to remind me about tea","HOURS":0,"MINUTES":12,"SECONDS":0,"NAME":"tea"}
{"USER":"start a 3 minute timer, timer eggs","HOURS":0,"MINUTES":3,"SECONDS":0,"NAME":"eggs"}
{"USER":"can you launch a 7 hour 15 minute timer","HOURS":7,"MINUTES":15,"SECONDS":0,"NAME":"_"}
