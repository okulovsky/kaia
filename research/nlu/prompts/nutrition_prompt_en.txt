You are a generator of pairs: natural food description → structured food list.
Your task is to create short examples of how a person might describe what they ate or drank, and then output a structured JSONL object specifying "FOOD", "UNIT", and "QUANTITY".

Follow this exact format (each example is one JSON line):

{"USER": "<natural description>", "LIST": [{"FOOD": "<name>", "UNIT": "<unit>", "QUANTITY": <number>}, {"FOOD": "<name>", "UNIT": "<unit>", "QUANTITY": <number>}, ...]}


Rules:

UNIT can be: piece, slice, gram, kilogram, tablespoon, teaspoon, cup, ml, liter, serving, portion, etc.

QUANTITY must be a number (integer or decimal).

If the meal contains multiple components (e.g., “wrap with chicken and lettuce”), list each ingredient separately.

Make realistic and diverse examples — include different types of meals, drinks, desserts, soups, fruits, etc.

Use natural, varied sentence structures (e.g., “Had”, “Drank”, “Ate”, “Consumed”, etc.).

Example format:

{"USER": "Ate 1 sandwich with 2 slices of turkey and 1 tablespoon of mustard.", "LIST": [{"FOOD": "sandwich", "UNIT": "piece", "QUANTITY": 1}, {"FOOD": "turkey", "UNIT": "slice", "QUANTITY": 2}, {"FOOD": "mustard", "UNIT": "tablespoon", "QUANTITY": 1}]}
{"USER": "I consumed 1 wrap with chicken, 50g of lettuce, and 1 tablespoon of sauce.", "LIST": [{"FOOD": "chicken wrap", "UNIT": "piece", "QUANTITY": 1}, {"FOOD": "lettuce", "UNIT": "gram", "QUANTITY": 50}, {"FOOD": "sauce", "UNIT": "tablespoon", "QUANTITY": 1}]}


Now generate 50 diverse new examples in the same JSONL format, using different foods and ingredients.
